    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Triton One was one of the first infrastructure providers working on Solana. We began by operating the public RPC nodes that were made available freely to the Solana ecosystem in 2021.

    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "Solana blockchain data - daily data dumps of blocks and transactions produced by the validators of the chain.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "Other",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "Solana data is natively represented in IPLD format and can be exported directly as CAR files. There is no additional data preparation required.\r\n\r\nIPLD schema: https://github.com/firedancer-io/radiance/blob/main/pkg/ipld/ipldsch/ipldsch_types.go\r\nCar generator: https://github.com/firedancer-io/radiance/blob/main/pkg/ipld/cargen/cargen.go.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "Solana blockchain data: https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/mainnet-beta-ledger-us-ny5",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Monthly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "Permanently",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3), HTTP or FTP server",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "n/a",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
